They both want control of a liberty pole to determine the true champion of liberty. On the top of the liberty pole is a Phrygian cap, a symbol of freedom that refers to the caps worn by freed slaves in the Roman Empire. The Tory holds a flag with a lion, representing the British monarchy. The American attached his flag, which depicts Boston’s Liberty Tree, to the liberty pole."

2,203,Boston's Neck,-71.06893,42.338525,,0203.jpg,"Boston neck was the only land route in and out of Boston at the time of the American Revolution. During particularly high tides, it was prone to flooding and could temporarily turn the peninsula into an island. Note the fortification shown there. Originally a wooden gate, British forces added an earthenworks fortification in 1774. Since the surrounding area was soft mud, it was impossible to pass into the town this way on foot except through the fortification, thus easily sealing Boston off from the mainland."
2,204,Cambridge Headquarters,-71.120202,42.373814,,0204.jpg,"George Washington established the headquarters of the colonial forces in Cambridge in July 1775 after being appointed Commander-in-Chief by the Second Continental Congress.

26,2602,Sugar Plantations,-61.876018,17.068125,,2602.jpg,"Slaves worked on sugar plantations that thrived on Caribbean Islands like Antigua. European nations colonized the islands to produce the profitable commodity during the 17th and 18th centuries. The rise of these plantations made sugar available to the masses, rather than just elites. "
27,2701,Royall House,-71.111851,42.410446,2701.jpg,2701.jpg,"Isaac Royall, Sr., an Antigua sugar plantation owner, moved to Massachusetts after purchasing this property on the Mystic River.

29,2902,Trade Competition,-21.624471,18.815057,,2902.jpg,"This note says: “The French had excluded the English from the Trade of this Coast to which they had a right.” Maps may not initially seem political, this note reveals the competition among European powers to gain control of the African coast, where traders sought gold, slaves, and other commodities."
29,2903,Phillis Wheatley,-16.413608,16.122303,,2903.jpg,"Phillis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet, is believed to have from the area of modern Senegal in Western Africa.

On the left is a coastal settlement. Barrels, possibly filled with molasses or tobacco, wait to be loaded onto the ship in the background. The title is framed by a palm tree and stalks of maize or corn, with a draped fishing net and beaver at the bottom. Two Native American figures, who represent America, wear headdresses and gaze upward at the title. The title is crowned by the royal crest and British flag, which signifies America’s dependence on Britain for protection and leadership."

Small hills flank both sides of the river, where sailboats skim the water. Shrubs and trees dot the landscape on the banks of the Hudson.

British merchant ships wait in the harbor for colonial goods to be loaded onto them. Three wealthy men, likely Virginia plantation owners, gather. One negotiates with a ship captain. Four enslaved Africans perform tasks; one serves wine to a planter, while three others prepare to load tobacco hogsheads on the awaiting ship. Virginia’s most important commodity was tobacco, and the colony’s economy was built upon slave labor. This scene shows the wealth and oppression in the colonies created by promise of profits from the tobacco trade."
35,3502,Future Site of the Capital,-77.053182,38.894861,,3502.jpg,"This area at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers later became the site of Washington, DC.

Indigo was used to make blue dye for clothing. Since blue was the most popular clothing color of the eighteenth century, indigo was a valuable commodity. Beneath two large palm trees, male slaves perform tasks on a plantation to prepare the indigo for sale. Nearby are plants, fruits, and vegetables that represent the area’s agriculture. "

45,4501,Fur Trade and Fishing,-53.020362,54.290786,,,"Britain was very interested in maintaining control of this region because the exportation of furs and codfish generated sizable income for merchants back in England.

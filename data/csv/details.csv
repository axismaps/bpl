92,9202,Frontier,-81.443875,39.42871,9202.jpg,,"Marietta, a town on the banks of the Ohio River, is the only major town on this map. In the late 18th century before the state was surveyed for settlement, Ohio was part of the American western frontier."
93,9301,Niagara Falls,-79.090298,43.085499,9301.jpg,,This map of Holland Land Company’s real estate interests in western New York includes the location of Niagara Falls. Two lines of text run across the map describing that the falls were formed out of a “horizontal Strata of Limestone” that is “about 450 Feet above the Surface of Lake Ontario.”
94,9401,Gideon Hawley,-70.579523,41.624026,9401.jpg,,"This plan of the Mashpee Reservation was made by an amateur mapmaker. Gideon Hawley, a Christian missionary to the Mashpee Indians, drew this map for Reverend Isaac Smith in 1785. Hawley likely created the boundaries based on his own survey of the landscape."
94,9402,Hawley's Manuscript,-70.483369,41.630071,9402.jpg,,"Gideon Hawley drew this map by hand. The manuscript contrasts with many of the printed maps in this collection. Even those printed maps, however, were based on original hand-drawn surveys like this one."
94,9403,Mashpee Meeting House,-70.463001,41.572279,9403.jpg,,"Gideon Hawley documented a Meeting House on the Mashpee land. Meeting Houses were an important part of New England politics and culture.

97,9701,United States and France,-58.531274,36.132919,9701.jpg,9701.jpg,"Lattré’s map has a ship cartouche in the bottom right. The ship refers to the importance of French naval support for America’s victory. A sailor hangs from the sails symbols of the United States, including the Great Seal of the United States and the insignia of the Society of the Cincinnati (a hereditary society founded by Continental Army officers). On the right, a liberty pole and cap poke out from the sail. These symbols emphasize that the United States and France are champions of freedom. On the right, a trident (the weapon of the Poseidon, the powerful classical god of the sea) signifies French naval power."
97,9702,"New Lines, Old Survey",-72.649901,41.870418,9702.jpg,,"Lattré based his map on John Mitchell’s 1755 map of North America, the most authoritative map of the colonial period. Mapmakers did not necessarily base their maps on new surveys; they sometimes copied existing maps. Lattré supplied new information by adding the boundaries of the new nation and its states."
97,9703,Florida and the Bahamas,-71.892776,34.458278,9703.jpg,,Compare the outlines of Florida and the Bahamas on this map and a modern map. You can see that they differ greatly. Florida was not yet part of the United States.

The map features prominent political figures George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Allegorical female figures, including Liberty and her liberty pole and the blindfolded Justice, also appear.

Above the figures, a herald with a trumpet and laurel wreath (representing victory) announces the birth of the new nation symbolized by the American flag."
98,9802,New Western Limits,-84.370625,34.856014,9802.jpg,9802.jpg,"The Mississippi River became the new western boundary (colored green) of the United States. Under British rule, the Proclamation of 1763 had established this boundary closer to the east coast, along the Appalachians. This older line separated colonial settlements from Native American territories. On this map it is colored orange and labeled as the “Antient [Ancient] Boundary of the Back Settlements or Indian Nations.”"

98,9804,Odd State Boundaries,-75.887561,42.825946,9804.jpg,,"After negotiating the boundaries of the United States with Great Britain, the new states had to negotiate their boundaries with each other. This map reflects the confusion over the new state boundaries. For example, the shape of New York State looks very different from its modern configuration. Maine and Vermont are not included because they were not yet states."
99,9901,Niagara Falls,-70.070446,32.56097,9901.jpg,9901.jpg,"The cartouche depicts Niagara Falls, which represented the sublime, untamed landscape of the United States. Two Native Americans converse near the top of the falls."
